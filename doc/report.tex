\section{Color Theory}

\begin{question}[1] {6.5}
The color corresponding to the pixel at N/2 has an RGB value of approximately
(127, 255, 127). Therefore, someone would see \textcolor{q1color}{a sickly pale
  greenish color} that turns out is very hard to read.
\end{question}

\begin{question}[2] {6.16}
Identify the gray levels in the given HSI images.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item This image is the intersection of all the primary colors. Thus, for hue
    values, we get $H(red) = 0$, $H(yellow) = 43$, $H(green) = 85$, and $H(cyan) =
    128$. Since hue ranges from 0 to 360 and we need to scale it to 0 to 255, we
    can simply calculate the angle and scale it for the rest: $H(blue) = 170$,
    $H(magenta) = 213$ and $H(white) = 0$.
  \item Since we're working with straight primary and secondary colors, the
    saturation is 0 for black or white and 255 for anything else.
  \item By the intensity formula, the primary colors have an intensity of 85,
    the secondary colors have an intensity of 170, white has an intensity of
    255, and black has an intensity of 0.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}[3] {6.20}
Describe the HSI components of the image:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item The HSI component images would appear as follows: the hue image would be
    four squares with the red square turning black (gray-level of 0), the green
    squares would turn dark gray (gray-level of 85), and the blue square would
    turn light gray (gray-level of 170); the saturation image would be completely
    white (gray-level of 255); the intensity image would be completely gray
    (gray-level of 85).
  \item Smoothing the saturation image would have no effect on it. The image
    would be unchanged.
  \item Since the hue image isn't entirely one level, applying an averaging mask
    would make the borders between the squares blur, and you'd see a gradient
    transition between each of the squares. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
 
\section{DCT Based Image Compression}

\setcounter{MaxMatrixCols}{20}
\begin{question}[1]

\subsection{Programming}

\section{ROI Segmentation}

\subsection{Linear Segments}

I implemented a linear Hough transform to detect lines in the image. Every line
can be represented as $r = x\cos{\theta} + y\sin{\theta}$ where $\theta$ is the
angle from the origin and $r$ is the distance a perpendicular line is away from
the origin at angle $\theta$. Therefore, we can transform the $xy$-plane into an
$r\theta$-plane.

Here is the image I will run a linear segmentation on:\\

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Building1}\\

Before I ran the Hough transform I first had to preprocess the image a bit.
OpenCV reads in color images in BGR format, so I first converted the image to
HSI and extracted the I channel, as it was the grayscale
version of this image. Then I applied the Sobel edge detector to extract the
edges out of this image. All values above a specific hard-coded threshold were
then examined in the Hough transform. The resulting transformation is shown
below:\\

\includegraphics[height=250,width=\textwidth,trim=0 0 0 70,clip]{LinearHoughVotes}\\

This image is a little small in height because I examined values of $\theta$
from $0$ to $90$, as values from $0$ to $360$ yielded similar results. But you
can clearly see intersections of sinusodial curves, which are likely candidates
for straight lines. I took the top 50 candidates and plotted them over the
original image:

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Building1Hough}\\

The resulting image clearly shows the algorithm has the right idea, though it's
focusing a lot on the borders of the image, which are in fact, lines. For some
reason the segmentation seems to prefer horizontal lines as well, but this may
be specific to this image. I also hypothesize that I'd have achieved better
results had I used a Canny edge detector instead, reducing some of the extra
noise from the Sobel image.

\subsection{Circular Segments}

We can also use a Hough transform to detect circles. Similarly, since the
equation of a circle is $r^2 = {(x - x_0)}^2 + {(y - y_0)}^2$, we can transform the
$xy$-plane into $x_0y_0r$-space. This requires an extra dimension of memory, as
a result induced a serious slow down on the region detection process. However,
extrememly accurate results were achieved:\\

\includegraphics{DiskHough}\\

The global maxima from the entire transform yields this very clear circle around
the white plate. Admittedly, the algorithm is fairly naive. The centers could be
any valid point in the picture and the radius dimension was bounded from $0$ to
$1/2$ the image width.

Some speedup could probably be achieved by increasing the
lower bound for radii (after all, we're trying to detect big significant
circles) and possibly by changing increasing the step change of the radius. For
larger radii, we also don't need to start looking for centers at the very edges
of the image, but instead gradually start closer to the center for larger radii.
This is because circular regions in the image with a large radius need to be
contained in the image, so their centers must be closer toward the center of the
image.That would significantly reduce the memory used and benefit the time as well (it
takes approximately 90--120 seconds to produce an output). Threading may also be
an option for further increases in speed.
